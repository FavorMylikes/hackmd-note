## Question

### Introduction

The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second diagram shows steps in the process of recycling used glass.

### Overview

We can see that glass is made using three main **raw materials**, and that the **manufacturing** process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.

### details

**At the first stage in** the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals **are mixed** together. Next, this mixture **is heated** in a glass furnace at approximately 1500C to produce molten glass. The molten glass can then **be shaped**, by blowing, to create the **end products**, namely glass containers

### details2

Glass recycling **begins with** the **collection** of used glass products. **The collected glass** is sorted according to its colour, **and then** washed in order to remove any impurities. **At the fourth stage** of recycling, the glass is crushed and **melted**, and **the resulting molten glass** can **finally** be moulded to create new items.
