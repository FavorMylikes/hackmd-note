The two pictures compare the current layour of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the smae living space.

### Ovewview

We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.

### Detailes

The most noticeable change from the existing to proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and understair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.

### Detailes2（copilot）

The other major change is that the kitchen will be moved from its current position in the north-west corner of the house to the south-east corner. This will involve removing the wall between the kitchen and the dining room, and also the wall between the kitchen and the utility room. The utility room will be moved to the north-west corner of the house, where the kitchen is now.

### Detailes2

to replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally the panned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.
