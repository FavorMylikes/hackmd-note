## Question

The graph below shows electricity production(in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012

### Introduction

> we paraphrase the question we just change some words

The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

### Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

> we are looking for very general information on the graph, something is definitely the highest over almost the whole period. and something is the lowest figures in the whole of the graph

**It is clear** that nuclear power was **by far the most** important means of electricity generation over **the period shown**. Renewables provided **the lowest amount** of electricity in each year.

### Details - compare the lines

> begin at the beginning with the first year, and renewables provided a negligible amount.

In 1980, **thermal** power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating **around 120 terawatt** hours of power. **Nuclear** and **hydroelectric** power stations produced **just under** 75 terawatt hours of electricity **each**, and **renewables** provided a **negligible amount**. Just one year latter, neclear power **overtook** thermal power **as the primary** source of electricity.

### Details

Between 1980 and 2005, **electricity production** from nuclear power **rose dramatically** to **a peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, the figure for thermal power **fell to** only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at this level** for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained **relatively stable**, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw **only a small rise** to **approximately** 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
